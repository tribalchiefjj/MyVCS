# MyVCS
# MyVCS - A Custom Version Control System


 😃 –  this is just a simple, version control system built from scratch! Think of it as your very own Git, but built the nerdy way. this vcs just did it for fun, to practice file I/O java(NGL i really do like java alot fr fr , its it hehe), about commit hashes, and idk just have some fun with coding 😂. 

## Why Build Your Own VCS?

Who needs Git when you can build your own system? 💁‍♂️

MyVCS is a learning project for anyone looking to understand the inner workings of version control systems. It gives you the power to:

- Stage files 📝 (`add` command)  
- Commit changes 💾 (`commit` command)
- View commit history 📜 (`history` command)

Plus, it’s a great way to practice file I/O – because who doesn’t love reading and writing files like a pro?

## Features

- init: Initializes a new repository in your project directory.
- add <file>: Stages a file for committing.
- commit <message>: Commits changes with a message.
- `history`: View the history of commits (SHA-1 hash values).
- `exit`: Exit the program when you’re done.


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project folder.
3. Start **MyVCS** by running the `Main` class in your IDE (Eclipse or VSCode).
4. Use the following commands:


 1. init       # Initializes the repository
 2. add <file> # Stages a file for commit
 3. commit <message> # Commits the changes
 4. history    # Displays the commit history
 5. exit       # Exit the program
 


## Future Enhancements (or not🤣.. )
- Implement branching and merging.
- Support for viewing diffs between commits.
- Add support for `.gitignore`-style file exclusion.
